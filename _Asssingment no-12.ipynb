This means that the learner's predictions become increasingly accurate and approach the best possible performance achievable.\n",

If the distribution of the features in the training data does not align well with the true distribution in the target population, the classifier may produce biased or inaccurate predictions.

The Naïve Bayes classifier leverages the probabilities of different words or features occurring in each class to make predictions.\n",
    "To use the Naïve Bayes classifier for text classification, the text data is typically preprocessed by tokenizing the text into words or n-grams and transforming it into a numerical representation, such as the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix. The classifier then learns the probability distributions of features (words or n-grams) in each class from a labeled training dataset. During prediction, the classifier calculates the posterior probabilities of each class given the observed features using Bayes' theorem and assigns the document to the class with the highest probability.\n",
