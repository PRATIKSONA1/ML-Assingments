    "Once the model is trained, a decision boundary is determined that separates the two classes based on the predicted probabilities.\n",
    "The decision boundary can be a linear boundary (for linear logistic regression) or a nonlinear boundary (for logistic regression with nonlinear transformations of the input features).\n",
    "Making Predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "To make predictions using logistic regression, the input feature vector is passed through the hypothesis function, and the output probability is compared to a threshold (usually 0.5) to determine the predicted class.\n",
    "If the predicted probability is greater than the threshold, the event is classified as belonging to one class, and if it is less than the threshold, it is classified as belonging to the other class.\n",
    "Logistic regression is widely used in various domains, including medical diagnosis, credit scoring, spam detection, and sentiment analysis. It is particularly suited for problems where the outcome is binary or categorical and requires estimating the probability of an event rather than predicting specific numeric values."
